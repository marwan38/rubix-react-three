## Rubix cube

A quick, 2 day project, made as a learning experience using **React-Fiber-Three** and **React-Spring**

## Controls
    - Use mouse to move camera
    - Q: Rotate front/back
    - W: Rotate bottom/top
    - E: Rotate left/right
    - 1~3: Change group being rotated

## TODO
    - Fix individual cube rotation transition (They rotate funny, although the end result is correct)
    - Make different sized cubes work properly by:
        1. Proper camera position based on cube size
        2. Assigning/removing keyboard keys based on size
        3. Fixing rotations with different sized cubes
